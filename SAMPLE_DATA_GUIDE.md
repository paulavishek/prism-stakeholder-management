## Management Commands Available

```powershell
# Populate fresh sample data
python manage.py populate_sample_data --user admin --clear

# Generate AI insights for existing data  
python manage.py generate_ai_insights --user admin

# Limit processing for testing
python manage.py populate_sample_data --user admin --clear
python manage.py generate_ai_insights --user admin --limit 5
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Server not accessible**: Ensure the development server is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- **Login issues**: Use the existing admin credentials
- **No data visible**: Check that you're logged in and data was created for the correct user
- **AI features not working**: This is expected without Gemini API key - mock responses are provided
- **Performance**: Sample data is realistic in size for testing without overwhelming the interface
