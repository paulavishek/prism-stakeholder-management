Enhanced Implementation Ideas
1. Demo Mode Toggle
Instead of just load/erase, consider a "Demo Mode" toggle:

Enable Demo Mode: Loads sample data + shows a banner indicating demo mode
Disable Demo Mode: Clears data and returns to normal mode
Visual indicator: Clear banner/badge showing "Demo Mode Active"

2. Smart Sample Data Strategy
Create realistic, comprehensive sample data that showcases all features:

Diverse stakeholder types: CEO, CTO, Product Manager, Legal Counsel, etc.
Various engagement types: Meetings, emails, calls, presentations
Different power/interest levels: To populate your interactive grid effectively
Rich profiles: Complete with AI-generated insights to show Gemini integration
Historical engagements: Past meetings with notes and outcomes
Upcoming meetings: To show scheduling features

3. Progressive Demo Options
Consider multiple demo scenarios:

Quick Demo (5-10 stakeholders): For rapid overview
Full Demo (20-30 stakeholders): For comprehensive testing
Specific Use Cases: "Tech Startup", "Enterprise Project", "Product Launch"

4. Additional UX Enhancements
Demo Tutorial/Walkthrough

Guided tour: Optional overlay highlighting key features
Feature callouts: "Try the AI insights here" or "Check the interactive grid"
Success metrics: "You've explored 5/8 key features"

Data Persistence Options

Session-based: Demo data expires after session
Time-based: Auto-cleanup after 24 hours
Manual control: User chooses when to clean

5. Implementation Approach

# Django management commands
python manage.py load_demo_data --scenario=tech_startup
python manage.py clear_demo_data
python manage.py toggle_demo_mode

Add to your dashboard:

Demo Mode Banner: Clear visual indicator
Feature Highlights: Tooltips showing "This uses AI" or "Interactive feature"
Usage Statistics: "Demo data includes 25 stakeholders, 40 engagements"

6. Recruiter-Specific Features
Landing Page Enhancement

Demo credentials: Pre-filled login (demo@example.com / password)
Feature checklist: "✓ AI Integration ✓ Data Visualization ✓ Responsive Design"
Time estimate: "2-minute demo" or "5-minute full exploration"

Export Demo Report

PDF Summary: Generated report showing app capabilities
Feature screenshots: Auto-generated during demo
Technical highlights: "Built with Django, Gemini AI, Chart.js"

7. Technical Implementation Tips

# Example models addition
class DemoSession(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    is_demo_mode = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    demo_started_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    demo_scenario = models.CharField(max_length=50, default='standard')
